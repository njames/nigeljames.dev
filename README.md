# nigeljames.dev

This is the repository for my website at [nigeljames.dev](https://nigeljames.dev).

It is open source - in that you can read it from here if you like and see the how the sausage is made.

The basics are that it is a [Pelican](https://getpelican.com/) static blog.

It will start with the basic template and I may tweak it from time to time but I am more focussed on getting out content than prettiness for it's own sake.

As this is a .dev domain this site will be focussed on development and software engineering.

Have a great day.
